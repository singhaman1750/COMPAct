## Testing

No formal test suite exists yet (no pytest, no `test_*.py` files). Minimal plan for periodic testing, in order of effort:

1. **Shell smoke test** — re-run the 11 known-good `(motor, gearbox_type)` combinations through `actOpt.py` and check none crash:
   - `U8 sspg`, `U8 cpg`, `U8 dspg`, `U8 wpg`, `RO100 icpg`, `RI100 insspg_type_1`, `RI100 insspg_type_2`, `RI100 incpg_dependent`, `RI100 incpg_independent`, `RO100 isspg_inside`, `RO100 isspg_compact` (all with ratio `6.5`)

2. **`test_actopt.py` (pytest)** — formalize (1) as a parametrized pytest file: run all 11 combos via `subprocess`, assert exit code 0 and `opt_parameters is not None`.

3. **Golden-output regression test** — extend (2) to assert the *exact* expected numbers (teeth counts, module, gear ratio) for each combo, not just "didn't crash." This is the one that would catch silent wrong-value bugs (e.g. the ICPG `maxContinuousCurrent`-not-passed issue found during the motor-class investigation) that still exit cleanly.

4. **CI hook** — add a `.github/workflows/test.yml` to run whichever of the above on every push/PR, so it happens automatically instead of manually.

Suggested starting point: combine (2) + (3) into one `test_actopt.py` (~40-50 lines).
